#Connected Component Labeling 
It's a technique in computer vision to detect connected regions.

##Implementation Details
This projects implements the 1-D Gaussian background subtraction algorithm. Each individual pixel is modeled using a Gaussian distribution.

###Notes
* Binary thresholding is applied by setting foreground to 255 (white) and background to 0 (black).
* Initial threshold (k) and temporal window (𝜌) values are set based on trail and error.
